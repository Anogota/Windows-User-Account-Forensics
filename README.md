# Windows-User-Account-Forensics

Hello we gonna make today Windows-User-Account-Forensics room.

<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>

üõ°Ô∏èIdentify and analyze forensic artefacts related to user and system accounts in Windows.

üõ°Ô∏èUnderstand the forensic aspects of the user account lifecycle, including creation, modification, and deletion.

üõ°Ô∏èDetect malicious activities through behavioural analysis and threat detection techniques.

üõ°Ô∏èInvestigate Group Policy Objects (GPOs) for security insights and potential exploitation.

üõ°Ô∏èApply forensic analysis techniques in practical scenarios to enhance investigative skill


<h3>1.Windows Account Types</h3>

Task 1:What type of accounts are used by the Windows operating system and various apps?
System and service accounts are special accounts in the Windows operating system and various apps. They automatically perform tasks and are designed to ensure software services and system processes function securely and efficiently.

Task 2:What centrally manages local user accounts and domain accounts?
Unlike local user accounts, domain accounts are centrally managed through a domain controller

<h3>2.Account Lifecycle Artefacts</h3>

Task 1:How many users were found using the DSInternals command?
First what we need to is open powershell as administrator and wrote a command ```ntdsutil.exe "activate instance ntds" "ifm" "create full C:\Exports" quit quit```, then ```$bootKey = Get-BootKey -SystemHivePath 'C:\Exports\registry\SYSTEM'``` To fetch the account details, we then call the Get-ADDBAccount cmdlet, passing the path to the NTDS.dit and the boot key: ```Get-ADDBAccount -All -DBPath 'C:\Exports\Active Directory\NTDS.dit' -BootKey $bootKey``` 

And the answer will be a: 5, you can search it that text what will be dsiplayed

Task 2:What is the value of the "bootKey" variable?
its take me while when i figured out, how can get that, that's the answer: 36c8d26ec0df8b23ce63bcefa6e2d821
```Get-BootKey -Online```

Task 3:What is the SID of the domain user, m.ascot?
